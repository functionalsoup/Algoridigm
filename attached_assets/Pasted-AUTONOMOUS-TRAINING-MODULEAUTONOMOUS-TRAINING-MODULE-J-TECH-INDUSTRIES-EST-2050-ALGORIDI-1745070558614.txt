### Theatre Workshop: Devising *MACHINAL* adaptation - ALGORIDIGM(working title)

Step into a world where mechanization becomes digitization, and the fight for autonomy takes place not on factory floors but inside algorithmic corporate data centers . This devised theatre workshop invites participants to collaboratively reimagine Sophie Treadwell’s _Machinal_—an iconic expressionist drama about a woman crushed by patriarchal systems and based of the real case of Ruth Snyder —through the lens of today’s AI-focused, data-obsessed society. In _Algoridigm_, we explore modern corporate culture, gendered tech hierarchies, digital alienation, and systemic control, building from Treadwell’s original nine-episode structure to craft a modern narrative of resistance and assimilation while staying true to her timeless purpose for writing the play, "To bring empathy to a life".

The purpose of the workshop is to experiment with the text, colab on script and design, and by the end come to a descision whether to move on to a full production. Just to be clear, **this is not a performance this is a purely pre-production based event**. Please just shoot me a message from the contact us form if you're interested in participating and I'll reach back out to you shortly.
